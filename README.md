This is my personal portfolio in making.

My name is Peeyoosh and I am an engineering graduate student. 
Recently web development caught my attention and now I am on my journey to learn this skill. 

When I think about why am I learning this skill ?, The following answer struck my mind - "To create neat&nice, Fast, Responsive web applications." 

And yes thats my answer ! 

For now I am planning to complete following projects to add in my portfolio -

1. Solid Waste Management Web Dashboard, which will be based on reward based system.

2. An E commerce web application for farmers. Where they can sold their produce online near their locality. 

3. Point of Sale web application with cloud.

4. Tourism Website for Ajanta caves.

5. Some commercial & NGO websites.
